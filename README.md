The repository contains python code for cache simulator. The simulator works for both unified and split cache memory. This is designed only for direct mapped and 4-way assocative cache. 

To obtain the results run following command -     

$ ./python cachesize blocksize associativity cachetype

(associativity can bre '1' or '4' for direct and 4-way associativity cache respectively and cache type can be 'U' or 'S' for unified or split cache respepectively.)
